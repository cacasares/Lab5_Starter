1. No, you would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application which allows a user to write and send a message to another user. As described by the write-up instructions, unit tests are meant for testing individual parts of your code and cannot test how individual components interact on an application level. Because the "message" feature involves at least two users, the sender and the receiver, unit testing would not be suitable for this. 
2. Yes, you would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application since it is an individual component that does not rely on an interaction with another component or user. The unit test would simply reject messages longer than 80 characters and only accept messages with 80 or less characters.
